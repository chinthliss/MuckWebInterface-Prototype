The bulk of this has moved to the roadmap page. This is largely just internal reminders.

### Revisit
* Account passwords don't need to have MUCK text limitations
* When someone is over their character slot limit, characters got locked out. Could highlight/show on web.

### After go live
* Remove tos-hash-viewed from account_properties
* drop billing_sessions
* drop patreon_claims
* Rewrite muck notifications to account notifications
* Wipe account prop values for 'webnoavatars' and 'webusefullwidth' because they're no longer relevant
